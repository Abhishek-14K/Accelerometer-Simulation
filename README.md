# Accelerometer-Simulation

Using STM32L476RG along with an ultrasonic sensor and two servos, design an arrangement where the ultrasonic sensor is used to determine the distance of an object which is depicted on one of the servos and the other servo is used to depict the velocity of the object. The sensor should read distance and velocity at a rate of 20 times per second. The user should also be able to obtain real time reading on the console where the distance is in the form of a linear graph.
